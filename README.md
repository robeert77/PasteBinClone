## This is a PasteBin Clone (https://pastebin.com/)

### In this app you can save some text(created for programming code, but works for everything).

You have to paste the content of your code, insert a title for it, and click a button. After that, you can see your paste at the top of the pastes list.
From the paste list, you can click any paste to view it, edit it or to delete it.
